# A2ZDataScience

## About

This GitHub repository provides a structured path for going from beginner to advanced in data science, machine learning, and specifically - generative AI. It includes textbooks, courses, research papers, tools, and guidelines for building practical projects.

The motivation is to aggregate quality resources covering data science and AI fundamentals before providing a deep dive into state-of-the-art generative modeling techniques. There is a focus on implementations in code and developing an intuition for what methods work best in different situations.
